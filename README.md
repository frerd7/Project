  <h2>My code repository</h2>
</div>

I built all these projects with dedication and passion for doing my job, each line of code was made with my own effort during these these years.
I show you my work:

- **Tsmaker:** <br>
      This is a program I built that is used to automate build tasks,
      such as execution, downloading dependencies, multitasking build, and single build.
  
- **QMLApp:** <br>
      It interprets user interface-oriented QML code and was developed using the Qt5 framework.It is currently capable of executing qml code and communicating with the desktop, such as sending notifications and running as a program.

- **QRFX:** <br>
      This is a recovery mode program based on Qt, what it does is start and provides options such as updating the system,
      cleaning the system of Linux packages, allowing you to use the USB memory to load a script,
      allowing you to preload the boot manager.
  
- **Python host-info:** <br>
      It is a script that sends requests to a host to know its information such as its dns, its ping, the header.

- **OSLG (Operating System Loader Grub):** <br>
	It is based on grub, this was an obsolete project that did not exist so I made modifications to it, its objective is to be a boot loader with a very intuitive graphical interface, among the modifications are the following: <br>
	- Oslg-Install (Written in python => its function is to install the boot manager and the disk drive, whether UEFI or BIOS.) <br>
	- Oslg-mkconfig (Written in python => this creates boot manager settings such as screen style on startup themes and startup time, select operating system) <br>
 	- Edit the program that creates the MS-PEs to be compatible with the UEFI version.
	- Add reboot in UEFI menu.
 
 - **Youtube Client Web:** <br>
        It is a YouTube client built in the gnome-gtk linux interface and can be run as a program without having to enter the browser.

 - **Hv2ray:** <br>
 	It is a program that uses the v2ray protocol, it allows you to connect to a network using the connection protocol. It is a graphical interface.

 - **XGLShow:** <br>
        It is a program that loads image frames, it is used in the Linux LighitDM Session Manager.
