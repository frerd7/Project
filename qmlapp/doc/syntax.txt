# FQmlapp is a program that seeks to 
# integrate the qml language with the 
# Gnome linux desktop
# Just like other programs, it is in its beta base, 
# so some errors will appear, which will be solved as the program is updated.
# This program is subject to a Gnu Linux public license which provides for 
# its sale and if it is done you should talk to the creator.

[Guide to use the program]:
	Step 1:
 	      Create an qml.txt file, remember that this file must contain the following;
              module: Specify the initial directory that contains the name of the module to load.
              appname: Object name either application or project.
              window: Type of window manager to use, it can be a host that uses OpenGL render, or it can be an engine that is used by qml.

         [Nota]:
             If no window manager is selected the program decides which one to use.
             The qml.txt file must always go in a particular directory as well as the script.

        [Example]:
                 # example
                 module: /path/to/$dir or ~/$dir or ./$dir
                 appname: Example 
                 window: host or engine
                 version: number
                 image: path to icon

        [Nota]:
           Do not annotate rare symbols will give an error.
           Don't put the directory name, just put the initial directory

       		Step 2:
            	Create a file with the syntax followed by qml data:
            	 [Example]: window host
                    #!/usr/bin/qmlapp #do not change this route just place it and that's it.
                     
                     import QtQuick 2.0

                     Item {
                        width: 700
                        height: 500
                       }

               	[Example]: window engine
                    #!/usr/bin/qmlapp  #do not change this route just place it and that's it.
                     
                    import QtQuick.Window 2.2

                     Window {
                        visible: true
                        width: 700
                        height: 500
                       }

                 [Nota]:
                  
                  do not change the interpreter position or direction.

        launch from terminal or a desktop file.
